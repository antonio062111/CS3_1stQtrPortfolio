### **List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.**

1. Js Overview and Syntax - I think I know my Js syntax decently enough for me to get by. I think I have enough knowledge about this to answer simple exercises, and maybe I'll need a little help from Google for more complicated tasks.

2. JS Operations - Mostly arithmetic operations like (+, -, *, /) I'm pretty confident with my knowledge on operations most especially because it's really similar to C++ which is my favorite. I only had to learn the difference onf "==" and "===", but it was pretty straight forward.

3. Control Statements - I found this lesson easy as it was just a refresh of CS2 lessons with the if-else or switch statements. I was fun to keep using my knowledge in CS2 now that im in CS3.

4. Loop Control Structures (While, Do-while, For) - As these lessons were taught in CS2 it was really straight forward only needing a little, if any, syntax change. This is one of my favorite lessons as its so satisfying when it works. One of my favorite loops is the for loop because its so simple and powerful with just its simple syntax of "for (x=0; x>y; x++){
 *code*
}".

5. Functions - Again, this lesson was fairly easy as it was taught in CS2. It's so fun to send a value when calling the function, then having the function do operations on it, then having it sent back to the main code.

### **List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.** 

1. How to use Github and VSCode - Github and VSCode is a brandnew lesson for me which I never experienced before. I also find it confusing most especially with the things you can do with it.

2. Variable Declaration - The part of variable declaration I want to discuss more about is the difference of all the variable? types like, var, let, const... I only really know the C++ ones like Int, Double, Float, String. So further discussion on this would really benefit me in understanding how to code in JS.

3. Commonly Used Js Number Ojects - As these were not discused in CS2 I find it a little confusing such as turning a value into a number or a value into a string. I only really experienced this now because in C++, the variable type would dictate that.

4. Input and Output Functions - In C+=, we only really used cout and cin, so the new ones are a little confusing. I think I could easily grasp the lesson if our discussion about it was more detailed.

5. Loop Control Structures (Break, continue) - These 2 loop control structures are a little confusing, but I know these were taught. I just want a refresh on their actual meaning.

### **Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.**

In order to help myself in understanding the topics listed above, I can...
1. Watch Youtube videos to remove my confusions.
2. Check the learning materials in khub.
3. Ask my classmates.
4. Ask my teacher.

### **In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?**

1. **Effective Activites** 
- **Speed Tests**  - These were effective because they made me apply what I learned in class and use them. They also motivated me because if I finish first in the row, I can get bragging rights and bonus points.
- **Exercises** - These were effective because, like in speed tests, they made me pratice my knowledge on the lesson.

2. **Not Effective Activities**
- **Kahoot Games** - These were not effective because I just end up guessing sometimes and I don't really get to apply my learnings.
- **In-class Coding Examples** - I find these not too effective because sometimes it goes too fast and I can't catch up.
